# EVErview


EVErview is an Tool for managing your account- and character settings:
  - Allow you to copy the settings from Account 1 to whatever many accounts you have (unfortunately, you have to select them manually)
  - Copies the Window-Layout from one character to another one.
  
# How to run the tool
You can either compile it on your own with the project files in this GitHub Repository or you download the ZIP-Archive from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UfZ0Ua7xoVy-TsibclC5oatGIHl36PKQ
Make sure the Newtonsoft-JSON DLL is located in the same folder as EVErview.exe.
  - You can run it by double-clicking "EVErview.exe"

# ToDo
If i ever feel bored or encouraged by you guys i can add some other features, im thinking of something like:
  - Support for different EVE Directories. I'm quite a newbro (compared to the eve history) so i only have the latest EVE Settings directory, i guess.
If something doesn't work out for you, feel free to message me!
  - An better way to copy account settings. I didn't find a way so far to "convert" the Account-Number from your Settings-Directory to the Account-Name (as seen in the launcher).
  
# Bugs/Features
  - There may be a problem with different Setting-Directories, usually these are located at %LocalAppData%\CCP\EVE  
  If this directory is missing/empty this tool won't work. Message me so i can take a look at it and fix it.

# Support
- As all of us, i hate doing PvE and other ISK generating stuff. For i am also an bad pirate i have to live of tips.
Feel free to support me with an nice ingame message or a tip to "Christian Gaterau" if you've found this tool somewhat helpful...
